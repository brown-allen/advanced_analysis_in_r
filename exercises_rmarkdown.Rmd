## Markdown Practice

### Create A Bulleted List
Created a bulleted list that has the name of three fruits.

### Create a Numbered List
Create a numbered list that indicates four vegetables

## Code Chunks

Create a few items from the normal distribution (hint: `rnorm`)

```{r}

```

## Tables


Make a `kable` table for the `mtcars` dataset

### Show the Code

```{r}

```

### Don't show the code!

```{r}

```


### Add a footnote with `kableExtra`?
hint you will need to load the `kableExtra` package using the library command.


```{r}

```


## Tabsets? {.tabset}

### Maybe this

Add a block quote like using `>`

### Or print a graph

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = 30)
```

## Add Some Code in `python`

But don't evaluate it!

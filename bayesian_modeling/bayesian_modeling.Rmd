# Bayesian Modeling in R

## A Thought Exercise

You are already Bayesian!  

You just didn't know it!

## A Coin

What is the probability a given coin is fair?

## Frequentist

If you didn't answer 100% or 0% you're Bayesian!

## What is Bayes?

- Named after Rev. Thomas Bayes

```{r eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("bayesian_modeling", "figs", "bayes.png"))
```


## Bayes Theorem

## Prior, Likelihood, Posterior Distribution

### Prior

### Likelihood

### Posterior

## Frequentist vs Bayesian Inferences

# Bayesian Workflow

## Doing Bayesian Inferences

## Create A Data Generating Process

Define your data generating process

Generate some fake data from it

## Write Your Model

Test it! Write a model, run it and test it.

## Domain Specific Languages

BUGS  
JAGS  
Stan  
Hand coded samplers 


## Enter `brms`

`brms` makes Bayesian Modeling Easy  

Utilises Hamiltonian Monte Carlo  with a No U-Turn Sampler


## Specifying a Model in `brms`

## Model Family

## Run the Model

## Posterior Checks

- Convergence  
  - Trace Plots `tracplot`
  - Rhat metrics
  - Effective Sample Size
  
- Posterior Predictive Intervals
  - Was there a good fit between the model and the data
  
## Inferences

## Advantages of Bayesian Analysis

- Takes advantage of expert opinion  
  - Especially helpful with small samples size studies  
  - Reduces possibility of wildly odd results  

- Easier communications (more intuitive to discuss probabilities)  

- Studies can build on one another
  - Results from one study can be supplied directly as a prior into a replciation or another study

## Drawbacks of Bayesian Inference

- Not as widely utilised in major publications  

- Computationally intensive 

- Picking a prior

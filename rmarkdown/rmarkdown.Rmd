# Why is `rmarkdown` important?


## It's all about communication and documentation!

1. We used have notebooks to document our work:

```{r notebook, echo=FALSE, out.width="100px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("rmarkdown", "notebook.jpg"))
```

2. Our reports change change with our data

## Reproducibility

- Tying our analysis to our output documentation

- No more of this <https://youtu.be/s3JldKoA0zw>

## Sold? So how do I do it?

Rmarkdown integrates R and the Markdown language into a single method

Rmarkdown documents end in `.Rmd` extension

Can be created from within the R Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Some technical details...

- `rmarkdown` (and `bookdown`) compile their outputs to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- Depending on the output specified
  - \LaTeX for pdf style outputs (and beamer)
  - html
  - html + javascript
  - ebpub
  - ...
- Specific commands can be issued depending on the output used (\LaTeX and/or html tags)

# Building Your Documents

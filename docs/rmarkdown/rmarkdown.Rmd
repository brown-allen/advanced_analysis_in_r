# Why is `rmarkdown` important?


## It's all about communication and documentation!

1. We used have notebooks to document our work:

```{r notebook, echo=FALSE, out.width="100px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("rmarkdown", "notebook.jpg"))
```

2. Our reports change change with our data

## Reproducibility

- Tying our analysis to our \alert{output documentation}

- No more of this <https://youtu.be/s3JldKoA0zw>

## Sold? So how do I do it?

- Rmarkdown integrates R and the Markdown language into a single method

- Rmarkdown documents end in `.Rmd` extension

- Can be created from within the [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Some technical details...

- `rmarkdown` (and `bookdown`) compile their outputs to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- Depending on the output specified
  - \LaTeX for pdf style outputs (and beamer)
  - html
  - html + javascript
  - epub
  - ...
- Specific commands can be issued depending on the output used (\LaTeX and/or html tags)

# Building Your Documents

## Three Components to an Rmarkdown Documents

1. \alert{yml} header than contains metadata and build instructions

2. \alert{Markdown} mark-up conventions

3. \alert{Code chunks} with language and output instructions

# Yet Another Markup Language

## Parts of An R Markdown Documents

`yml` header instructs to `pandoc` engine how to build the documents

```

```

## You can access R code from within the yml

Utilising back ticks and the letter "r" you can \alert{include R code into your `yml`}

## A Little More About Outputs...

### Rmarkdown Outputs
- pdf_document
- word_document
- html_document

### Presentations
- io_presentation
- beamer_presentation

### My Preferred
- bookdown::pdf_document2^[Almost identical to pdf_output but provides additional control over code chuck references. Requires the `bookdown` package]

# Markdown

## Rmarkdown = R + Markdown

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) developed as an easy way to implement `html` style formatting

- Keyboard symbols to generate basic `html` outputs

- Additionally allows you to interleave plain text with code

## Markdown Examples

```
_italics_ or *italics*

__bold__ or **bold**

sub~script~

super^script^

```
$\leadsto$

## Markdown Examples


_italics_ or *italics*

__bold__ or **bold**

sub~script~

super^script^

## Markdown Examples

R Studio hosts a ton of great example Rmarkdown reports [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)

# Code Chunk

## Using Code Chunks

Rmarkdown documents are powerful because of \alert{code chunks}

They can be inserted into a document by `CMD/CTRL + OPTION + I`

Best practice is to \alert{name each chunk} to help with debugging

## Writing R Code

Write code just like you would with any R scripts:

- call libraries 
- write code 
- any code is executed and printed as in the console

```{r}
rnorm(1, 10, 1)
```

## Compiling the Documents

\alert{A document will not compile if a chunk has an error!}


## Use Chunk Options to Control the Outputs

Some times you don't want everything printed when you compile (knit) the document

Different messages that can be set for \alert{each} code chunk:

- `Echo` - If `false` then \alert{no code is printed}
- `Warnings` - If `false` \alert{no warning messages} are printed
- `Messages` - If `false` \alert{no messages} are printed
- `Include` - If `false` \alert{no echo, no warnings, no messages} printed
- `Eval` - If `false` the chunk \alert{won't be evaluated}
- `Error` - If `true` allows chunk to \alert{display an error}

## Use Chunk Global Options

Chunk options can be set \alert{locally} or \alert{globally}

Global options are over-written by local options

Accessing global options

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```


## Accessing _Other_ Languages

```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

## Setting Engine

Generally you will need specify where the executable file is to run other languages

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path = list(
  python = '~/anaconda/bin/python',
  ruby = '/usr/local/bin/ruby'
))

```

## A Motivating Example

Write my code is `Stan` specifying `output.var = "stan_example"` in the chunk options

```{stan, output.var = "stan_example", cache=TRUE, results='asis'}
parameters {
  real y[2];
}
model {
  y[1] ~ normal(0, 1);
  y[2] ~ double_exponential(0, 2);
}
```

## Fit the Model

```{r cache=TRUE}
library(rstan)
fit <- sampling(stan_example, cores = 2, 
                iter = 50, refresh = 0)
```

## Print the Results Directly

```{r}
print(fit)
```

## Controlling Output

Chunk options can also be used to specify

- output size of figure via \alert{fig.out, fig.width, fig.height} 

- captions with \alert{fig.caption}

## Automating Rmarkdowns

An additional `yaml` argument can be passed call `params`

```
---
params:
  team: "Wake Forest"
  sport: "Football"
---
```

## Using the Parameters

The parameters can be be used in other code chunks

```
data %>% 
filter(team = params$team, sport = params:sport)

```

And now the code will function for any available team/ sport you specify.

## A Report for Each Team and Sport!

Further, if you desired a standard report for different combinations of team

```
purrr::pwalk
```

## Making Basic Tables

The basic way to make a table in R is through the `kable` function from `knitr`

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars,4)[,1:3])
```

## Additional Table Options

The basic way to make a table in R is through the `kable` function from `knitr`

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars,4)[,1:3], 
             caption = "A Basic Table", 
             col.names = c("One", "Two", "Three"))
```


# Extending RMarkdown

## LaTex

- You can use LaTex extensively 

- This include LaTex templates and cls for control

- Different citation styles

```
---
includes:
  in_header: my_format.tex
---
```


## Advanced Packages

### Table/ Figure Generation
- `kableExtra`
- `gt`

### Templates
- `rticles`
- `papaja`
- `markdowntemplates`

### Even More
- `flexdashboard`
- `shinydashboard`

# Scripts vs Rmds

## Everything in an Rmd File?!

### Always
- Final reports/ analysis
- Exploratory work

### Except
- Code outnumbers Prose -> scripts
- Can run large scripts from within an Rmd with `source`

### But...

`knitr::purl` can make an Rmd into an R file


# Summary

## Key Points

1. Rmarkdown files are a good way to produce reproducible documents
2. Whatever format you want can be done (but it might be a challenge)
3. You can work in _multiple_ languages!
